      <h3>The Challenge: High Traffic, High Stakes</h3>&nbsp;
      <p>Large-scale campuses face unique challenges. With a mix of pedestrian traffic, hotel valet services, and heavy delivery truck rotations, faded pavement markings create more than just an eyesore—they create a liability. The client's property featured a complex layout including a "Main Street" thoroughfare with high-visibility areas that required crisp, professional aesthetics, commercial delivery zones essential for keeping logistics moving without blocking traffic, hotel valet areas where clear stenciling is vital for the guest experience, and multi-level parking garages—enclosed environments where clear wayfinding is critical for driver safety and OSHA compliance.</p>
      &nbsp;
      <h3>The Process: A Phased Approach to Precision</h3>&nbsp;
      <p>Because this campus is a high-traffic hub, a "one and done" approach would have disrupted daily operations. Instead, we worked closely with the management team to execute a piecemealed, multi-year maintenance cycle. This ensured that the property remained functional while undergoing a total transformation. Our technical execution included surface preparation by cleaning and prepping all asphalt and concrete surfaces to ensure maximum paint adhesion, exterior Main Street marking by refreshing the double yellow center lines, stop bars, directional arrows, and pedestrian crosswalks, specialized stenciling for "Delivery Zones" and "Hotel Valet" areas to designate right-of-way and prevent parking congestion, safety curbing by applying high-visibility yellow curbing to prevent accidents and define boundaries, and a full garage overhaul by re-painting all lines and stencils within the attached parking structures to improve wayfinding in low-light conditions.</p>

  conclusion: `
      <h3>The Result: Ongoing Compliance and Safety</h3>&nbsp;
      <p>By treating this project as a recurring maintenance cycle, the client never has to worry about their property falling into disrepair. As soon as one phase of the campus is completed, the next begins, ensuring that the property always meets the highest standards of safety and "Main Street" curb appeal.</p>&nbsp;
      <p>The result is a campus that is not only beautiful but is also fully compliant, organized, and safe for every visitor, employee, and guest.</p>&nbsp;
